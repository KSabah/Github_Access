# Github_Access
This project takes in a github username and returns the user's repositories in a bubble chart, where the bubbles each represnt a repository and correspond to the amount of commits the user has made to them. The aim is to allow the user to compare information on various different user's repositories.

The project needs to be run twice to load the data from Github, and then to display the chart. 
It was written primarily in Javascript, with HTML and CSS for the styling and for the chart. The project can be run from the terminal by using github_access.js, and then loading localhost:3000 on the web browser. Input a valid Github username, and click the button to load the information.
